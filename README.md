Paragraph is an application software that creates documents from many text nodes which supporting version control.

Paragraph joins text nodes in many methods like:

- Joining text nodes.
- Embedding/rendering text node in text node, check text node is available in.
- Reference/address text node to text node, check text node is referenced/addressed in.

Paragraph can reference difference text node version in distribution by text node address, this means you can manage your text node in DRY ( do not repeat your self), in history.
